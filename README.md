<h1>Underwater horror shooter idea.</h1>

<h2>Setting:</h2>

<p>The player is an astronaught deep in space, they end up (insert bad event here) and needs to make
an emergency landing on a mostly water-based planet. The landing goes wrong and they must eject from the ship.
The ship crashes into the planet, scattering the ship into pieces. The player must dive down into dark depths to collect all pieces
so they can restore their ship and leave the planet.</p>

<h2>Gameplay:</h2>

<p>Player is attached to a rope, and must use Spacebar to pull themselves up. To descend, they can press nothing and float down. Horizontal movement is normal with A and D.Sea Horrors will spawn and harass/attack/chase the player, and the player can defend themselves with a variety of guns or hold space to pull themselves back to the surface.</p>

<h2>Level ideas:</h2>

<p>Instead of just open water, we can implement caves the player can navigate.</p>

<h2>Other ideas:</h2>

<p>Have an indicator to show where a ship piece could be.</p>
